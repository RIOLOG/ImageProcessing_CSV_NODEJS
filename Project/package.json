  "description": "Image Processing System is a web application designed to handle image data from CSV files. It allows users to upload CSV files containing product information and image URLs. The application validates and processes these images by compressing them to 50% of their original quality. It then stores the processed images and associated product details in a database. Users receive a unique request ID upon submission and can later check the status of their request through a dedicated API.",
